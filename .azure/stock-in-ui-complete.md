# ✅ Stock-In UI - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented the **Stock-In UI** system that allows warehouse staff to receive shipments from purchase orders directly into storage locations. The system is **fully interconnected** with Products, Purchase Orders, Inventory Items, and Backorders.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Stock-In API Route ✅
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/stock-in/receive/route.ts`

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/stock-in/receive`

**Functionality**:
- Receives multiple items from a purchase order
- Assigns each item to a specific storage location
- Updates inventory quantities
- Updates PO item receivedQty
- Updates PO status (Pending → Partial → Completed)
- Fulfills backorders automatically
- Creates inventory transaction records
- Revalidates all related pages

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "purchaseOrderId": "67890abc...",
  "items": [
    {
      "poItemId": "item123...",
      "locationId": "loc456...",
      "quantity": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Updates**:
1. ✅ **PurchaseOrderItem.receivedQty** - Increments by received quantity
2. ✅ **PurchaseOrderItem.lineStatus** - Updates to Partial/Completed
3. ✅ **InventoryItem.quantity** - Creates or updates inventory at location
4. ✅ **Product.stockOnHand** - Increments total stock
5. ✅ **InventoryTransaction** - Creates STOCK_IN record with details
6. ✅ **Backorder.status** - Updates to Partial/Fulfilled
7. ✅ **PurchaseOrder.status** - Updates based on all items

### Interconnections:

**1. Purchase Orders → Stock-In**
- POs with Pending/Partial status appear in receive dropdown
- PO items show ordered vs received quantities
- Receiving updates PO status automatically

- Selected PO items link to specific products
- Receiving increments Product.stockOnHand
- Product info displayed during receiving

**3. Stock-In → Inventory**
- Each received item assigned to storage location
- Creates or updates InventoryItem records
- Tracks quantity per product-location pair

**4. Stock-In → Transactions**
- Every receipt creates InventoryTransaction
- Records: product, location, quantity, price, PO reference
- Provides audit trail for all stock movements

**5. Stock-In → Backorders**
- Automatically checks for related backorders
- Updates backorder status based on received quantity
- Fulfills backorders when items arrive

- ✅ **Progress indicators** (Ordered vs Received vs Remaining)
- ✅ **Success/Error messages** with icons
- ✅ **Responsive tables** with proper column widths

---

## 📊 Business Logic

### PO Status Calculation:
```typescript
const allCompleted = allItems.every(item => item.receivedQty >= item.orderedQty);
const anyReceived = allItems.some(item => item.receivedQty > 0);

if (allCompleted) {
  poStatus = "Completed";
} else if (anyReceived) {
  poStatus = "Partial";
} else {
  poStatus = "Pending";
}
```

### Backorder Fulfillment:
```typescript
for (const backorder of openBackorders) {
  if (updatedPoItem.receivedQty >= updatedPoItem.orderedQty) {
    backorderStatus = "Fulfilled";
  } else if (updatedPoItem.receivedQty > 0) {
    backorderStatus = "Partial";
  }
}
```

### Inventory Updates:
```typescript
// If inventory exists at location
if (existingInventoryItem) {
  newQuantity = existingQuantity + receivedQuantity;
}
// If new location assignment
else {
  create new InventoryItem with quantity;
}

// Always update product total
product.stockOnHand += receivedQuantity;
```

---

## 🛡️ Validation & Error Handling

### Request Validation:
- ✅ Purchase Order ID required
- ✅ Items array must not be empty
- ✅ Each item must have poItemId, locationId, quantity
- ✅ Quantity must be > 0
- ✅ PO must exist
- ✅ Location must exist and be active
- ✅ PO item must exist

### Error Messages:
```typescript
"Purchase Order ID and items are required"
"Purchase order not found"
"Location {id} not found for item {name}"
"Invalid data for item {id}"
"Failed to receive shipment"
```

### Partial Success Handling:
- If some items fail, others still process
- Returns both `results` and `errors` arrays
- Shows which items succeeded and which failed

---

## 🔍 Transaction Logging

Every received item creates a transaction record:

```typescript
{
  productId: "product123",
  locationId: "location456",
  kind: "STOCK_IN",
  quantity: 100,
  unitPrice: 25.50,
  purchaseOrderId: "po789",
  purchaseOrderItemId: "poitem012",
  note: "Received from PO: po789 - ABC Supplier - Location: Main Warehouse"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Complete audit trail
- Who received what, when, where
- Price tracking for valuation
- Links back to source PO
- Supports Transaction History page (future sprint)
